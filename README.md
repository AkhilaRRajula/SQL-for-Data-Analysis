# SQL for Data Analysis - Hands-On Practice
This repository contains my notes and exercise files of course "SQL for Data Analysis". This course provided a comprehensive introduction to SQL and its application in data analysis, emphasizing practical skills and effective decision-making through data insights.

## AIM:
The aim of this course was to build a solid foundational knowledge of SQL for data analysis, focusing on fundamental queries and their application in deriving insights from data.

## Agenda of the Project:
* Review of SQL basics
* Fundamental SQL queries for data analysis
* Asking the right questions of your data
* Translating questions into SQL queries
* Deriving insights for effective decision-making
* Integrating SQL queries with tools like Microsoft Power BI

## Data Pipeline:
The course guided us through creating a data pipeline that involved querying, processing, and visualizing data. We learned to transform raw data into meaningful insights by leveraging SQL queries and integrating them with Power BI for visualization.

## Tech Stack:
* __SQL:__ For querying and analyzing data 
* __Microsoft Power BI:__ For data visualization and reporting
* __GitHub Codespaces:__ For hands-on practice in a cloud developer environment 
* __VS Code:__ For running and testing SQL scripts

## Key Takeaways:
* Understanding of basic and advanced SQL queries
* Ability to ask insightful questions of data
* Skills in translating business questions into SQL queries
* Practical experience in using SQL for data analysis
* Proficiency in integrating SQL queries with Power BI to visualize data
* Hands-on practice with GitHub Codespaces for a seamless development experience

## Instructions:
* __Prerequisites:__ Ensure you have SQL and Microsoft Power BI installed.
* __Exercise Files:__ Each chapter folder contains the sample files mentioned in the videos.
* __Setup:__ For Chapter 5, install the necessary extensions for Python and Jupyter in VS Code.
* __View Creation:__ Before starting Chapter 5, create the V_Orders View by running the "Create View V_Orders.sql" file.
* __Tips:__ Restart the kernel in Chapter 5 to stop the dashboard from running on port 8050.
